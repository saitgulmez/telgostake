    question: "What is the Casper Network?",
    answer:
      "The Casper Network is an open-source Proof of Stake blockchain network built off the CBC (Correct-by-Construction), the Casper Network specification originally established by early Ethereum developers. The Casper network is optimized for enterprise and developer adoption by focusing on unique features like upgradeable contracts, predictable network fees, privacy flexibility, on-chain governance, and developer-friendly languages. The Casper Network solves the scalability trilemma by allowing development teams to build with confidence that the network will optimize for security, decentralization, and high throughput.",
  },
  {
    question: "When did the Casper Network mainnet launch?",
    answer: "Mainnet launched March 31, 2021.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How does the Casper Network solve the trilemma of security, decentralization, and scalability?",
    answer:
      "As a Proof of Stake network, the Casper Network relies on a set of validators to uphold the network. PoS validators do not require the same hardware setup as Proof of Work networks, allowing validators to be more geographically decentralized and eliminating the centralizing pressures of economies of scale. PoS also enables scalability mechanisms like sharding, allowing the network to process multiple transactions simultaneously, improving overall throughput.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is staking/delegation and what is the purpose of staking?",
    answer:
      "Delegation allocates your CSPR tokens to a chosen validator on the network who is participating in the Casper Network's Consensus Protocol. In other words, staking is a process in which token holders can earn rewards by securing their tokens helping to secure a blockchain network.The purpose of staking is to provide security to a blockchain. Staking ensures that all the transactions made on the blockchain are verified and secured.",
  },
  {
    question: "How frequently the staking rewards are paid?",
    answer:
      "Staking rewards are paid to your account on a per ERA basis. One Era is currently set to 2 hours.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does unstaking usually take?",
    answer: "Undelegating takes 7-8 ERAs, or 14-16 hours.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is eras?",
    answer: "An era is approximately 2 hours",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the APY?",
    answer:
      "Expected annual percentage yield on the staked funds without taking the validator's fee into account.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the commission rate?",
    answer:
      "Commission rate represents the percentage of the reward that the node operator retains for their services. A rate of 100% means the validator keeps all of the rewards, leaving zero to the delegators",
  },
  {
    question: "What is motes?",
    answer:
      "1 CSPR is 1,000,000,000 motes. For more information visit https://docs.casper.network/concepts/glossary/M/#motes",
